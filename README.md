# ðŸŒŸ Machine Learning in Production ðŸŒŸ

## âœ¨ Course Completion Repository âœ¨

Welcome to my repository for the **"Machine Learning in Production"** specialization offered by **DeepLearning.AI** on Coursera. This repository serves as a collection of labs, projects, and notes from the course, reflecting my journey in learning how to take ML models from development to deployment and beyond in real-world scenarios.

It's one thing to build a model; it's another entirely to make it work reliably and efficiently in production! This course dives deep into the critical aspects of the ML lifecycle outside of just model training.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

Through this specialization, I gained a deep understanding of the end-to-end ML project lifecycle and the challenges of deploying ML systems. Key learning points include:

* Identifying the key components of the ML project lifecycle and pipeline.
* Selecting the best deployment and monitoring patterns for different production scenarios.
* Optimizing model performance and metrics by prioritizing disproportionately important examples that represent key slices of a dataset.
* Solving production challenges regarding structured, unstructured, small, and big data.
* Understanding why label consistency is essential and how to improve it.

## ðŸ’¼ Skills Gained

Equipped with practical knowledge, I've developed the following skills essential for MLOps and production ML:

* ML Deployment Challenges
* Human-level Performance (HLP) analysis
* Concept Drift detection and handling
* Project Scoping and Design for ML projects
* Applied Machine Learning principles in production settings
* Establishing Model baselines
* Overall proficiency in Machine Learning lifecycle management

## ðŸ“‚ Course Labs and Projects

This repository contains the code and notebooks from the hands-on labs and the final project of the course. These files demonstrate the concepts learned, including deployment strategies and handling real-world data challenges.

You will find notebooks such as:

* `C1W2_Ungraded_Lab_Birds_Cats_Dogs.ipynb` (Likely a lab focusing on data handling or model evaluation)
* `FinalProject.ipynb` (The culmination of the course, applying learned principles)
* `cloud-deploy.ipynb` (Demonstrating deployment to cloud platforms)
* `docker-deploy.ipynb` (Illustrating containerization for deployment)
* `server-coursera.ipynb` (Potentially related to setting up serving infrastructure)

*(**Note:** Specific instructions on running these notebooks might depend on the lab requirements. Refer to the original course materials if needed.)*
